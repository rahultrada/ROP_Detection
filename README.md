This repository contains the code and report for my master's thesis regarding the interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks trained to detect Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP). The file main.py contains the code to train a classifier, as well as to generate explanations for the classifier's predictions using LIME, and through generating backpropagation-based saliency maps.
